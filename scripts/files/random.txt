Perhaps you have wondered how predictable machines like computers can generate randomness. 
In reality, most random numbers used in computer programs are pseudo-random, 
which means they are generated in a predictable fashion using a mathematical formula. 
This is fine for many purposes, but it may not be random in the way you expect if you're used to dice rolls and lottery drawings.
